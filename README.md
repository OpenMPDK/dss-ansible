### Ansible HostÂ Setup

#### *Linux Packages*

On a linux host, install Ansible version 2.9.12 using python3. Do not use a package-manager version of Ansible.

     yum install -y python3
     curl <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py> -o get-pip.py
     python3 get-pip.py
     python3 -m pip install ansible==2.9.12

### Download Deployment Bundle

Download the deployment bundle to the Ansible host.

## VM Cluster Setup

Clusters with 4 and 10 VM nodes are supported, and have been tested.

### Enable Ansible SSH to Cluster

Ensure Ansible can access all VMs in the cluster.

#### *Add Ansible user*

A user should be provisioned on all hosts in the cluster with "NOPASSWD" sudo access.
Ansible will use this account for all automated configuration.
Alternatively, the root user can be used instead.

#### *Generate SSH key*

Generate SSH key on Ansible host, unless already generated.

        #ssh-keygen
        Generating public/private rsa key pair.
        Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ylo/.ssh/id_rsa):
        Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
        Enter same passphrase again:
        Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.
        Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
        The key fingerprint is:
        SHA256:GKW7yzA1J1qkr1Cr9MhUwAbHbF2NrIPEgZXeOUOz3Us user@host
        The key's randomart image is:
        +---[RSA 2048]----+
        |.*++ o.o.        |
        |.+B + oo.        |
        | +++ *+.         |
        | .o.Oo.+E        |
        |    ++B.S.       |
        |   o * =.        |
        |  + = o          |
        | + = = .         |
        |  + o o          |
        +----[SHA256]-----+

#### *Copy key for ansible login*

Copy ssh key to each of the hosts using the shh-copy-id command.

        ssh-copy-id ansible@testhost01.domain.com

To copy keys to 10 hosts automatically:

        for i in {01..10}; do sshpass -p "ansible" ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ansible@testhost${i}.domain.com; done

#### *Test cluster nodes for ansible login*

To confirm the ssh key copy, test if you can login to the hosts using ssh without the password.

### Prepare Inventory File

Configure an Ansible inventory file for the cluster.
Below is an example inventory file defining a cluster of 10 TESS servers, with one also used as a client.

        [servers]
        msl-ssg-vm11.msl.lab tcp_ip_list="['10.1.51.35']" rocev2_ip_list="['192.168.199.11']"

## Install and Start DSS Software Stack

### First time Deployment

* Configure VMs

    ```ansible-playbook -i your_inventory playbooks/configure_vms.yml```

* Deploy TESS:  Deploy and start TESS software stack

    ```ansible-playbook -i your_inventory playbooks/deploy_dss_software.yml```

### Complete Playbook documentation

#### playbooks/cleanup_dss_ai_benchmark.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

Execute this playbook in the event that "start_dss_ai_benchmark" has failed.
This playbook will terminate stuck warp processes.
Additionally, kernel packet pacing will be removed from each server.

#### playbooks/cleanup_dss_minio.yml

Execute this playbook to cleanup minio object store metadata.
This playbook will stop minio, and execute cleanup from a single node of each cluster in your inventory.
This will effectively remove any metadata at the root level of the object store.

Note that this will create the appearance of a reformated object store, but space will not be reclaimed.
Note that if a bucket is re-created after executing cleanup, its child objects will become accessible again.

#### playbooks/configure_hosts.yml

Execute this playbook to configure hosts prior to deploying DSS / TESS software.
This playbook will deploy custom kernel, install YUM / python dependencies, and configure OFED.
Note that presently, only versions of CentOS between 7.4 and 7.8 are supported

#### playbooks/configure_inbox_infiniband.yml

Execute this playbook to deploy the in-box Infiniband Support group.
This playbook is intended to be used to configure VMs or hosts where OFED is not desired.
Note that if configuring a host with inbox Infiniband Support, OFED must be removed from the system first.
Note that hosts configured with inbox Infiniband Support must be configured in your inventory with
"tcp_ip_list" and "rocev2_ip_list" lists populated. See README.md for additional details on inventory configuration.

#### playbooks/configure_vlans.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

Execute this playbook to automatically configure VLANs in Mellanox / Onyx environment.

Hosts that are configured with this playbook do not need to have "tcp_ip_list" and "rocev2_ip_list" lists defined in inventory.
If these vars are not defined, Ansible will attempt to automatically discover IP / VLAN configuration, as configured by this playbook.

Environment MUST have Mellanox Onyx switch configured in inventory.
Onyx Switch(es) must be included under the [onyx] group in your inventory file.
Switch credentials must be provided using "ansible_user" and "ansible_ssh_pass" vars for each Onyx host or the entire [onyx] group.
Key-based authentication is not possible with Onyx.

It is critical to review the "rocev2_vlans" and "tcp_vlans" vars under "group_vars/all.yml" to auto-configure VLANs on Onyx.
To make changes to the default values, uncomment these vars and make changes to "group_vars/all.yml" or add them to your inventory file.
There must be an even number of physical interface ports available, with each pair of ports corresponding to one TCP and one RoCEv2 VLAN/IP.
IPV4 last octet / IPV6 last hextet are automatically derived based on the presence of a digit appended to each hostname in your inventory.
If a unique number cannot be automatically derived from each hostname in your inventory, a number will automatically be assigned to each host
in your inventory, starting with "1".
You can specify a static last octet to each host by assigning the variable, "last_octet" for each host in your inventory file.
Additionally, you can offset the automatically derived last octet for a host, or a group, by assigning a "last_octet_offset" var for each host or group.
For example, given two hosts in your inventory: "server_01" and "client_01"
You can assign "last_octet_offset=100" to "client_01", which will result in "client_01" having a derived last octet of "101"

VLAN IDs for all Onyx switches, clients, and servers must be assigned in your inventory file using "tcp_vlan_id_list" and "rocev2_vlan_id_list" vars.
The VLAN IDs provided in these list must correspond to the VLAN IDs provided in "rocev2_vlans" and "tcp_vlans" lists, as mentioned above.
If using multiple Onyx switches, it is thus possible to spread your VLANs across multiple switches.
Note that if a host and switch both are tagged with a VLAN ID, it is expected that there is a physical link between this switch and host.
If no link is detected, the playbook fail on this assertion.

Note that it is possible to assign multiple VLANs to a single physical link using the "num_vlans_per_port" var as a host / group var.
For example, a host with "num_vlans_per_port=2" and 2 physical ports will allow the use of 4 VLANs (2 TCP and 2 RoCEv2)

#### playbooks/configure_vms.yml

Execute this playbook to configure VMs, or other hosts using the in-box Infiniband Support group.
This playbook is intended to be used to configure VMs or hosts where OFED is not desired.

Note that if configuring a host with inbox Infiniband Support, OFED must be removed from the system first.
Note that hosts configured with inbox Infiniband Support must be configured in your inventory with
"tcp_ip_list" and "rocev2_ip_list" lists populated. See README.md for additional details on inventory configuration.

#### playbooks/debug_dss_software.yml

Execute this playbook to run a series of basic status debug tests .
This playbook will perform the following actions:

* Get a count of running minio instances on each host
* Get a count of running target instances on each host
* Search for errors in all minio logs across all hosts
* Search for errors in all target logs across all hosts

#### playbooks/deploy_datamover.yml

Execute this playbook to deploy the datamover, client library, and their dependencies.
Artifacts are deployed to hosts under the [clients] group.
Note that it is possible for hosts to appear under both the [clients] and [servers] groups.
Hosts under the [clients] group will be used for datamover distributed operations.
This playbook will also create configuration files for client library and datamover, based on hosts that appear in your inventory.
Please review "Datamover Settings" under "group_vars/all.yml" if you wish to adjust the default settings of the datamover.
Uncomment vars with new values, or add them to your inventory file.

Re-running this playbook will update the datamover configuration across all hosts in your inventory.

#### playbooks/deploy_dss_ai_benchmark.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

Execute this playbook to deploy the DSS AI Benchmark software.
This playbook will also create configuration files for client library and datamover, based on hosts that appear in your inventory.
Please review "Datamover Settings" under "group_vars/all.yml" if you wish to adjust the default settings of the datamover.
Uncomment vars with new values, or add them to your inventory file.

Re-running this playbook will update the datamover configuration across all hosts in your inventory.

Additionally, KVSSDs (with KV firmware) will be formated cleanly.

#### playbooks/format_restart_dss_software.yml

Execute this playbook to restart DSS software to all hosts in your inventory.
This playbook is effectively identical to running "stop_dss_software", then "start_dss_software".
Additionally, KVSSDs (with KV firmware) will be formated cleanly.
SSDs (with block firmware) will be re-formated with mkfs_blobfs.

#### playbooks/redeploy_dss_ai_benchmark.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

Execute this playbook to redeploy the DSS AI Benchmark software.
This is effectively the same as executing "remove_dss_ai_benchmark" then "deploy_dss_ai_benchmark" playbooks.

#### playbooks/redeploy_dss_software.yml

Execute this playbook to redeploy DSS software to all hosts in your inventory.
This playbook is effective the same as executing "stop_dss_software", "remove_dss_software", then "deploy_dss_software".
Data present across back-end storage will persist after redeploy.

#### playbooks/remove_dss_ai_benchmark.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

This playbook is effective the same as executing "stop_dss_software" then "start_dss_software".

#### playbooks/start_compaction.yml

Execute this playbook to start the compaction process across all [servers].
Compaction is useful to reclaim space on backing storage devices after WRITE or DELETE operations.
Note that this playbook will wait and retry until compaction has completed across all hosts.
Compaction may take a very long time with very large datasets.
The default timeout is 12,000 seconds (200 hours)
The timeout may be changed by setting the "start_compaction_timeout" var.
For example, to start compaction with a 400 hour timeout:
    ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> playbooks/start_compaction -e 'start_compaction_timeout=24000'

Compaction status is checked every 15 seconds by default. This value can be user-defined with the "start_compaction_delay" var.

#### playbooks/start_datamover.yml

Execute this playbook to start the datamover accross all [clients].

By default, "start_datamover" will execute a PUT operation, uploading all files from your configured NFS shares to the minio object store.
Please review the "Datamover Settings" section of "group_vars/all.yml"
It is critical to set the "datamover_nfs_shares" to match your environment.
IPV4, IPV6, or resolvable hostnames are accepted for the "ip" key.

Additional operations supported by "start_datamover: PUT, GET, DEL, LIST, TEST

* PUT: Upload files from NFS shares to object store
* GET: Download files from object store to a shared mountpoint on all [clients]
* LIST: List objects on object store. Produces a count of objects on object store, and saves a list of objects to a default location.
* DEL: Delete all objects on object store, previously uploaded by datamover.
* TEST: Perform a checksum validation test of all objects on object store, compared to files on NFS shares.

This playbook has a number of user-definable variables that can be set from the command line to run the operation you choose:

* datamover_operation: PUT
* datamover_dryrun: false
* datamover_compaction: true
* datamover_prefix: ''
* datamover_get_path: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/datamover"

For example, to execute datamover GET operation to a writable, shared mount point across all [clients]:
    ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> playbooks/start_datamover -e 'datamover_operation=GET,datamover_get_path=/path/to/share/'

For additional documentation, please consult the datamover README.md file, located on all [clients]:
> /usr/dss/nkv-datamover/README.md

#### playbooks/start_dss_ai_benchmark.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

Execute this playbook to destartploy the DSS AI Benchmark software.
This playbook will also create configuration files for client library and datamover, based on hosts that appear in your inventory.
Please review "Datamover Settings" under "group_vars/all.yml" if you wish to adjust the default settings of the datamover.
Uncomment vars with new values, or add them to your inventory file.

#### playbooks/start_dss_software.yml

Execute this playbook to start DSS software to all hosts in your inventory.
This playbook is idempotent, and will only start DSS processes if they are not already running.

#### playbooks/stop_dss_software.yml

Execute this playbook to stop DSS software on all hosts in your inventory.
This playbook is idempotent, and will only stop DSS processes if they are not already stopped.
The following actions will be performed on all servers:

1. Stop MinIO
2. Unmount NVMeOF targets / remove kernel driver
3. Stop Target

Note: Disks will remain in user space (SPDK)

#### playbooks/stop_reset_dss_software.yml

Execute this playbook to stop DSS software to all hosts in your inventory.
Additionally, once DSS software is stopped, disks will be returned back to kernel mode (SPDK reset).

#### playbooks/support_bundle.yml

Execute this playbook to collect a basic support bundle on all hosts.
This playbook will search all hosts for core dumps (by default, under /var/crash/).
A support bundle will be generated, including the core dump as well as:

* target logs
* minio logs
* dmesg logs

Support bundle will be downloaded to a local path, defined by "local_coredump_dir" var.
For example, to download support bundles from all hosts to your local home directory:

    ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> playbooks/support_bundle.yml -e 'local_coredump_dir=~/tess_support/'

By default, a support bundle will always be downloaded. To only generate a support bundle if a coredump is detected,
set the "coredump_only" var to 'true'. Example:

    ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> playbooks/support_bundle.yml -e 'local_coredump_dir=~/tess_support/,coredump_only=true'

#### playbooks/test_network.yml

Execute this playbook to perform a basic set of network tests across all hosts.
All hosts will ping each other across TCP IP's, and RoCEv2 IPs.
An ib_read_bw test will then run, and assert that measured throughput is at least 90% of link speed.

#### playbooks/test_nkv_test_cli.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

Perform a basic nkv_test_cli test and report observed bandwidth.

#### playbooks/upgrade_dss_software.yml

Execute this playbook to upgrade DSS software to all hosts in your inventory.
This playbook is equivelent to executing "stop_dss_software" then "deploy_dss_software"
Note that software will only be upgraded if new binaries are placed under the "artifacts" directory.

#### playbooks/upgrade_kvssd_firmware.yml

NOTE: For internal Samsung / DSS use! Unsupported!

This playbook can be used to upgrade the firmware of PM983 SSDs. All other models not supported.
In order to upgrade firmware, a valid firmware binary must be copied to the "artifacts" directory.
Then the "target_fw_version" must be commented out in all vars / defaults files.

### Client Components

The client library and data mover are provided to load data into the cluster from an NFS share.

* Client Library: please refer to its README file and the run example under dss_client directory.

* Data Mover: Installing the data mover is possible by executing the following playbook using Ansible.

```ansible-playbook -i your_inventory playbooks/deploy_datamover.yml```

* Data Mover configuration: Review `Datamover Settings` in `group_vars/all.yml`.
* Uncomment relevent changes as they apply to your specific environment, most imporantly `datamover_nfs_shares`:

        ```yaml
