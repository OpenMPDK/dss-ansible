# List of test cases to execute.
# Test cases must include:
#   - id: ID of test case to run - may be a JIRA ticket # in case of regression/defect
#   - description: Plain-English description of test case (objective of the test case)
#   - steps: A list of steps to perform. Can be one of the following in any order:
#     - put
#     - get
#     - delete
#     - put_get_delete
#     - list
#     - put_list
#     - lock_unlock
#     - chunked_put
#     - rdd_get
#     - rdd_chunked_get
#     - chunked_del
#     - rdd_put
# Note:
#   - list operation will validate the number of objects at the unique key prefix of the test case.
#     It is expected to perform "list" after "put" to validate keys exist.
#     By default it is asserted that "list" will find a number of keys equaling threads x objects.
#     If a different number of keys is expected (eg: list before put, list after delete) you can
#     specify the expected num. keys by setting "expected_list_keys" for each test case.
# Optional settings for each test case:
#   - keysize: key size of each object in bytes (min: 1, max: 1024)
#   - valsize: value size of each object in bytes (min: 1, max: 1048576)
#   - threads: number of threads
#   - objects: number of objects to write (per thread)
#   - integrity: use data-integrity test
#   - mixed_io: small meta io before doing a big io
#   - simulate_minio: generate IO pattern similar to MinIO
#   - assert_num_keys: Expected number of keys to find during list operation (default: num. objects x num. threads)
