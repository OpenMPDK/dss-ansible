; This is a sample inventory demonstrating typical settings when using Dell R7515 disaggregated targets and hosts.
; NVMeOF subsystems are provisioned across the targets, and mounted on the single host.
; In this scenario, the Onyx switch is automatically configured for front and back-end high speed networking.
; Additionally, Ansible  will automatically configure VLANs and provision IP addresses to all high-speed
; Connect-X adapters on all clients and servers.

; The `ansible_user` var must be defined for the playbook to manage the hosts using a different user-id
; than you are currently logged in with.
; This cluster uses a single VLAN for front-end TCP, and a single VLAN for back-end RoCEv2 traffic. The VLANs and their prefixes are explicitly defined
; in this inventory, rather than using the defaults (as found in `group_vars/all.yml`)

; Ansible will automatically provision the last-octet of each high-speed IP, based on the presence of the number
; contained in the hostname of each server/client host. Since there is overlap between servers and clients,
; setting a `last_octet_offset` here will offset the clients' IP addresses by 100 to avoid conflict.
; If conflit cannot be avoided, the playbook will automatically assign non-conflicting IP's to each host.
; For additional control on VLAN allocation, please see `group_vars/all.yml`, "VLAN defaults".
