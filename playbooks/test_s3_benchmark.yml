### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/test_s3_benchmark.yml
#
# Perform a basic s3-benchmark test and report observed throughput.
# This playbook will execute a suite of s3-benchmark tests in order:
#
# 1. Put
# 2. Run compaction
# 3. Get
# 4. Delete
# 5. Run compaction
#
# Upon test complection, throughput is reported for PUT and GET.
#
# A single s3-benchmark instance will be spawned on each client, one for each IP in `tcp_ip_list`.
# Each s3-benchmark instance points to a random MinIO endpoint, of a corresponding VLAN index.
# A Single MinIO endpoint can only be assigned to a single s3-benchmark instance.
#
# Note that for accurate results, NTP must be configured.
# This can be done automatically with the `configure_hosts.yml` playbook.
#
# s3-benchmark can be tuned by configuring the following vars (default values shown):
#
# * s3_benchmark_bucket_prefix - Bucket prefix for s3-benchmark data (default "s3-bucket-")
# * s3_benchmark_num_objects - Number of objects for each thread (total objects = objects x threads) (default 1000)
# * s3_benchmark_num_objects_vm - Number of objects if host is a VM (for VMs with lower throughput) (default 100)
# * s3_benchmark_object_size - Size of each object (default "1M")
# * s3_benchmark_num_threads - Number of threads (default 28)
# * s3_benchmark_duration - s3-benchmark PUT test duration in seconds (default 60)
# * s3_benchmark_async_timeout - Async timeout in seconds (increase for larger dataset) (default 600)
# * s3_benchmark_async_retry_delay - Async retry delay in seconds (5)
# * s3_benchmark_max_instances_per_client - Max. number of s3-benchmark instances per client. 0 == no limit (limited by num. IPs in tcp_ip_list) (default 0)
#   * if s3_benchmark_max_instances_per_client is set to a number larger than the number of TCP IP's on each client, multiple s3-bench instances per IP may
#     be spawned
# * s3_benchmark_strict_numa - Limit s3-benchmark instances to one-per-NUMA node on client, if multiple IPs in tcp_ip_list share same NUMA (default true)
