### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/test_s3_benchmark.yml
#
# Perform a basic s3-benchmark test and report observed throughput.
# This playbook will execute a suite of s3-benchmark tests in order:
#
# 1. Put
# 2. Run compaction
# 3. Get
# 4. Delete
# 5. Run compaction
#
# Upon test complection, throughput is reported for PUT and GET.
#
# A single s3-benchmark instance will be spawned on each client, one for each IP in `tcp_ip_list`.
# Each s3-benchmark instance points to a random MinIO endpoint, of a corresponding VLAN index.
# A Single MinIO endpoint can only be assigned to a single s3-benchmark instance.
#
# Note that for accurate results, NTP must be configured.
# This can be done automatically with the `configure_hosts.yml` playbook.
#
# s3-benchmark can be tuned by configuring the following vars (default values shown):
#
# `s3_benchmark_bucket_prefix`: `s3-bucket-`    - Bucket prefix for s3-benchmark data
# `s3_benchmark_num_objects`: `1000`            - Number of objects for each thread (total objects = objects x threads)
# `s3_benchmark_num_objects_vm`: `100`          - Number of objects if host is a VM (default reduced due to lower throughput)
# `s3_benchmark_object_size`: `1M`              - Size of each object
# `s3_benchmark_num_threads`: `28`              - Number of threads
# `s3_benchmark_duration`: `60`                 - s3-benchmark PUT test duration in seconds
# `s3_benchmark_async_timeout`: `600`           - Async timeout in seconds (increase for larger dataset)
# `s3_benchmark_async_retry_delay`: `5`         - Async retry delay in seconds
# `s3_benchmark_max_instances_per_client`: `0`  - Max. number of s3-benchmark instances per client. 0 == no limit (limited by num. IPs in `tcp_ip_list`)
# `s3_benchmark_strict_numa`: `true`            - Limit s3-benchmark instances to one-per-NUMA node on client, if multiple IPs in `tcp_ip_list` share same NUMA
