### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/cleanup_dss_minio.yml
#
# Execute this playbook to cleanup MinIO object store metadata.
# This playbook will stop MinIO, and execute cleanup from a target node of each cluster in your inventory.
# This will effectively remove any metadata at the root level of the object store.
#
# Note that this will create the appearance of a reformated object store, but space will not be reclaimed.
# Note that if a bucket is re-created after executing cleanup, its child objects will become accessible again.
