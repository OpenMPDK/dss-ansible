### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/deploy_datamover.yml
#
# Execute this playbook to deploy the datamover, client library, and their dependencies.
# Artifacts are deployed to hosts under the [clients] group.
# Note that it is possible for hosts to appear under both the [clients] and [servers] / [targets] / [hosts] groups.
# Hosts under the [clients] group will be used for datamover distributed operations.
# This playbook will also create configuration files for client library and datamover, based on hosts that appear in your inventory.
# Please review "Datamover Settings" under "group_vars/all.yml" if you wish to adjust the default settings of the datamover.
# Uncomment vars with new values, or add them to your inventory file.
# It is critical to specify the correct values for your NFS shares for the `datamover_nfs_shares` var.
#
# Re-running this playbook will update the datamover configuration across all hosts in your inventory.
