### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/test_ib_read_bw.yml
#
# Execute this playbook to perform ib_read_bw tests across `[targets]`, `[servers]`, and `[hosts]`.
# Each endpoint will execute multiple instances of ib_read_bw server per RoCEv2 IP.
# All remote clients will spawn an instance of ib_read_bw and record cumulative throughput for each run.
# At the end of the test, it is asserted that throughput is at least 90% of link speed.
#
# ib_read_bw can be tuned by configuring the following vars (default values shown):
#
# | Var name                  | Default   | Description                                              |
# | ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
# | ib_read_bw_starting_port  | 18515     | Starting port number of each incremented server instance |
# | ib_read_bw_duration       | 10        | Duration of each test, in seconds                        |
# | ib_read_bw_size           | 1048576   | Size of each message in bytes                            |
# | ib_read_bw_qp             | 1         | Number of queue pairs                                    |
# | ib_read_bw_sl             | 3         | Infiniband service level                                 |
