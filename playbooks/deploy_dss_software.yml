### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/deploy_dss_software.yml
#
# Execute this playbook to deploy DSS software to all hosts in your inventory.
# This playbook will perform the following:
#
# * Deploy, configure, and start target on all [servers]
# * Deploy, configure, and start nkv-sdpk host driver to all [servers]
# * Deploy, configure, and start MinIO instances to all [servers]
# * Optionally deploy, configure, and start UFM to all [ufm_hosts]
# * Deploy and configure datamover and client library to all [clients]
#
# Note that core dumps are enabled on all [servers] hosts.
# By default, core dumps will be compressed and stored in `/var/crash`.
# Please ensure your host has enough disk space to store core dumps, if you wish to use for debugging.
# This path can be changed by setting the `coredump_dir` var. see: /group_vars/all.yml
