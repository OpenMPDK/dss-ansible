### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/start_compaction.yml
#
# Execute this playbook to start the compaction process across all [servers].
# Compaction is useful to reclaim space on backing storage devices after WRITE or DELETE operations.
# Note that this playbook will wait and retry until compaction has completed across all hosts.
# Compaction may take a very long time with very large datasets.
# The default timeout is 12,000 seconds (200 hours)
# The timeout may be changed by setting the "start_compaction_timeout" var.
# For example, to start compaction with a 400 hour timeout:
#
#     ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> playbooks/start_compaction -e 'start_compaction_timeout=24000'
#
# Compaction status is checked every 15 seconds by default. This value can be user-defined with the "start_compaction_delay" var.
