### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/start_datamover.yml
#
# Execute this playbook to start the datamover accross all [clients].
#
# By default, "start_datamover" will execute a PUT operation, uploading all files from your configured NFS shares to the MinIO object store.
# Also by default, compaction will run once PUT is complete.
# Please review the "Datamover Settings" section of "group_vars/all.yml"
# It is critical to set the "datamover_nfs_shares" to match your environment.
# IPV4, IPV6, or resolvable hostnames are accepted for the "ip" key.
#
# Additional operations supported by "start_datamover: PUT, GET, DEL, LIST, TEST
#
# * PUT: Upload files from NFS shares to object store
# * GET: Download files from object store to a shared mountpoint on all [clients]
# * LIST: List objects on object store. Produces a count of objects on object store, and saves a list of objects to a default location.
# * DEL: Delete all objects on object store, previously uploaded by datamover.
# * TEST: Perform a checksum validation test of all objects on object store, compared to files on NFS shares.
#
# This playbook has a number of user-definable variables that can be set from the command line to run the operation you choose:
#
# * datamover_operation: PUT
# * datamover_dryrun: false
# * datamover_skip_upload: false
# * datamover_compaction: true
# * datamover_prefix: ''
# * datamover_get_path: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/datamover"
#
# Explanation of configurable vars:
#
# * datamover_operation - Datamover operation, one of PUT, GET, DEL, LIST, or TEST
# * datamover_dryrun - Execute datamove operation without making changes (applies to PUT, GET, DEL)
# * datamover_skip_upload - If `true`, do not upload during datamover TEST operation. Data must already be uploaded
# * datamover_compaction - Execute target compaction on each node after PUT, DEL, or TEST operations. Should always be set to `true`
# * datamover_prefix - Prefix of path to perform datamover operation on a subset of the total number of objects
# * datamover_get_path - Path to download objects during GET and TEST operations. For GET, path should be a shared mountpoint on all [clients] hosts
# * datamover_put_retries - Number of times to retry PUT operation if incomplete upload is detected
#
# Additional datamover vars:
#
# * datamover_client_user_id - Username datamover should use to communicate with other nodes in the cluster
# * datamover_client_password - Password datamover should use to communicate with other nodes in the cluster (leave blank for ssh key-based authentication)
# * datamover_conf_dir - Path to datamover configuration file
# * datamover_dir - Path to datamover installation files
# * datamover_list_path - Path to datamover list files logfile
# * datamover_debug - Enable / disable verbase datamover debug messaging in logs
# * datamover_data_integrity - Enable / disable data integrity check on get operation
# * datamover_master_workers - Number of datamover master application workers
# * datamover_master_max_index_size - Size of datamover master application index
# * datamover_master_size - Datamover master size
# * datamover_client_workers - Number of datamover client application workers
# * datamover_client_max_index_size - Size of datamover client application index
# * datamover_message_port_index - Datamover message port ID
# * datamover_message_port_status - Datamover message port status ID
# * datamover_nfs_shares - A list of NFS servers and shares containing the following keys:
#   * ip: An IP address of hostname of an NFS server
#   * shares: a list of NFS shares exported from the NFS IP
# * datamover_bucket - Datamover bucket name
# * datamover_client_lib - Datamover client library
# * datamover_logging_path - Path of datamover logs
# * datamover_logging_level - Datamover logging level
# * datamover_gcc_version - Datamover GCC version
# * datamover_index_data_queue_size - Number of entries in datamover index queue
# * datamover_awslib_log_debug - Enable or disable AWS lib debugging
