#
# Execute this playbook to deploy the in-box Infiniband Support group.
# This playbook is intended to be used to configure VMs or hosts where OFED is not desired.
# Note that if configuring a host with inbox Infiniband Support, OFED must be removed from the system first.
# Note that hosts configured with inbox Infiniband Support must be configured in your inventory with
# "tcp_ip_list" and "rocev2_ip_list" lists populated. See README.md for additional details on inventory configuration.
