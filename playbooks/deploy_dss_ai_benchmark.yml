# Execute this playbook to deploy the DSS AI Benchmark software.
# This playbook will also create configuration files for client library and datamover, based on hosts that appear in your inventory.
# Please review "Datamover Settings" under "group_vars/all.yml" if you wish to adjust the default settings of the datamover.
# Uncomment vars with new values, or add them to your inventory file.
