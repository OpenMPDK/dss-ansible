### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/support_bundle.yml
#
# Execute this playbook to collect a basic support bundle on all hosts.
# A support bundle will be generated, including any coredumps found (by default, under /var/crash/),
# as well as the following the following logs:
#
# * target logs
# * MinIO logs
# * dmesg logs
#
# The support bundle will be downloaded to a local path, defined by `local_coredump_dir` var.
# For example, to download support bundles from all hosts to your local home directory:
#
#     ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> playbooks/support_bundle.yml -e 'local_coredump_dir=~/tess_support/'
#
# By default, a support bundle will always be downloaded. To only generate a support bundle if a coredump is detected,
# set the `coredump_only` var to `true`. Example:
#
#     ansible-playbook -i <your_inventory> playbooks/support_bundle.yml -e 'local_coredump_dir=~/tess_support/,coredump_only=true'
