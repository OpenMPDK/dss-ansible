### Playbook Documentation ###
#
# #### playbooks/test_nkv_test_cli.yml
#
# By default, perform a basic nkv_test_cli test and report observed throughput.
# This playbook will execute a suite of nkv_test_cli tests in order:
#
# 1. Put
# 2. Run compaction
# 3. Get
# 4. Delete
# 5. Run compaction
#
# Upon test completion, throughput is reported for PUT and GET.
#
# Optionally, this playbook can be used to execute a suite of regression test cases.
# This can be done by changing the value of `nkv_test_cli_test` from `smoke` to `suite`.
# The default set of test cases can be found in `roles/test_nkv_test_cli/vars/suite001.yml`.
# You can create additional test suites using this file as a template.
# You can specify your custom test suite by setting `nkv_test_cli_suite` to `your-test` (default: `suite001`).
#
# nkv_test_cli can be tuned by configuring the following vars (default values shown):
#
# | Var name                       | Default      | Description                                                                           |
