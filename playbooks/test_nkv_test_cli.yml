#
# Perform a basic nkv_test_cli test and report observed throughput.
# This playbook will execute a suite of nkv_test_cli tests in order:
#
# 1. Put
# 2. Run compaction
# 3. Get
# 4. Delete
# 5. Run compaction
#
# Upon test completion, throughput is reported for PUT and GET.
#
# nkv_test_cli can be tuned by configuring the following vars (default values shown):
#
# `nkv_test_cli_keysize`: `60`        - Key size in bytes. Max size = 255
# `nkv_test_cli_valsize`: `1048576`   - Value size in bytes. Max size = 1048576
# `nkv_test_cli_threads`: `128`       - Number of threads
# `nkv_test_cli_objects`: `2000`      - Number of objects for each thread (total objects = objects x threads)
# `nkv_test_cli_vm_objects`: `100`    - Number of objects if host is a VM (default reduced due to lower throughput)
