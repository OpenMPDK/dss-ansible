; This is a sample inventory demonstrating typical settings when using Dell R7515 collocated servers.
; In this scenario, the Onyx switches are automatically configured for front and back-end high speed networking.
; Additionally, Ansible  will automatically configure VLANs and provision IP addresses to all high-speed
; Connect-X adapters on all clients and servers.
; The servers in this inventory are composed of two groups of logically separate clusters, across two separate switches.
; In this configuration, DSS Client Library is leveraged to aggregate data across the clusters.

; Half of the servers belong to `cluster 0`, and the other to `cluster 1`. They will be deployed independently from each other.
