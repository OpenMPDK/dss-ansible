; In this scenario, the Onyx switches are automatically configured for front and back-end high speed networking.

; Connect-X adapters on all clients and servers.

; Ansible will automatically provision the last-octet of each high-speed IP, based on the presence of the number

; setting a `last_octet_offset` here will offset the clients' IP addresses by 100 to avoid conflict.
; If conflit cannot be avoided, the playbook will automatically assign non-conflicting IP's to each host.
; For additional control on VLAN allocation, please see `group_vars/all.yml`, "VLAN defaults".
